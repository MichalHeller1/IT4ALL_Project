# IT4ALL_Project
# Network Analysis

Welcome to the Network Analysis Project! This project aims to address customer complaints related to network devices and connectivity issues. Our goal was to create a web application that visualizes and analyzes networks and devices deployed at customer locations.

## Project Stages

### Research

In order to realize this project we had to research and understand basic network concepts. Key topics include network packets, the OSI model, interfaces, MAC addresses, IP addresses, routers, switches, .cap files, ARP, and small network basics.

<!-- Add more stages as necessary -->

## Functionalities

- Upload .pcap files to analyze network devices and connections.
- Query connections in a network to map device relationships.
- Query information about networks to retrieve a list of installed devices.
- User-based authentication system for technicians.
- <!-- Include additional features here -->
